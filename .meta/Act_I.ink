BOSTON, 1922
Office of Dr. Alaric Thorne

Dr. Thorne: 
"Feeling better today, Mr. Sharpe?"
    *   [Yes]
        You:
        "Yes… I suppose I do. Breakfast was good—especially the coffee. And the lady who brought it was kind, though… a bit elusive."
        Dr. Thorne:
        "If you’d like, I can have more coffee sent in. Or perhaps some tea?"
        You:
        "No, thank you. I think I’ve had enough comforts for the moment."
        You sit up a little.
        "What I’d like now is to know how it came to be that you’re my host."
    *   [Today?]
        You:
        Today...?
        Dr. Thorne: 
        "Yes. I didn’t expect full clarity just yet. It’s not unusual." a pause
        "You’re safe now."
        ** You: Where am I?
    *   [Sharp you say?] 
        You:
        "Sharp, huh? That’s generous. I’ve been feeling more like Mr. Blunt."
        Glance around the room.
        "You’ve got a respectable setup here, Doctor. Shame I don’t remember checking in. Your name was on the door—mine, apparently, was in your files."
        A beat.
        "So... little help?"
- Dr. Thorne:
    “You’re in Boston,” he says, pausing for a beat, “at my clinic.”
    “The police brought you here three nights ago—severely cold, and in a rather disturbed state. You were discovered near the waterfront, they told me. It took two days for your condition to stabilize.”

    He adjusts his posture slightly, eyes calm but attentive.

    “We spoke briefly yesterday about what happened, but…” another pause, longer this time, “…can you tell me, Mr. Sharpe—what took you to Gull Island?”
